# Sorting algorithm visualizer
Built with React.js
https://lucasbelin.github.io/sorting-visualizer/

There are a lot of different sorting algorithms out there and wanted to visualize them, which is why I built this application.

# How it works
By default, the numbers of values to sort is 50 but you can change it with the slider next to the "Generate new array" button.
While it is sorting you can not change the animation speed or start a new algorithm.
Once it is finished sorting you need to create a new set of values using the button or slider on the left.
